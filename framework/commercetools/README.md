# Commercetools Provider

To deploy you will need a commercetools account with an existing project.
Then copy the `.env.template` file in this directory to `.env.local` in the main directory (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp framework/commercetools/.env.template .env.local
```

Then, set the environment variables in `.env.local` to match the ones from your project.
